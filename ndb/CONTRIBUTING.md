## Contributor License Agreements

  Before we can accept your pull requests you'll need to sign a Contributor
  License Agreement (CLA):

  - **If you are an individual writing original source code** and **you own the
  intellectual property**, then you'll need to sign an [individual CLA][2].
  - **If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work**,
  then you'll need to sign a [corporate CLA][3].

  You can sign these electronically (just scroll to the bottom). After that,
  we'll be able to accept your pull requests.
